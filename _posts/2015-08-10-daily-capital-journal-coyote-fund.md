The whole skin of one bobcat, including head and claws, and the entire skin of one coyotte [sic], also including head and claws were laid on the counter of the county clerk’s office yesterday by J. H. Maulding of Silverton. He claimed under the bounty act, which was changed by the last legislature, $4.00 for the coyote and $2.00 for the bobcat and this amount was paid, to be charged up to the bounty fund.

In its wisdom in changing the bounty laws for the skins of wild animals, the last legislature reduced the bounty on coyotes to $4.00 if it happens to be a female, instead of $5.00 as formerly and $3.00 for the skin of male coyote. As Mr. Maulding wished to keep the skins of the bobcat and coyote, instead of cutting off the claws as evidence, the ears of each were perforated.

During the past ten years the bounty laws for the skins of wild animals have been changed from time to time and as the law now stands, a coyote pup skin is worth $3.00, female coyote $4.00 and male coyote, $3.00, bobcats of wild cats $2.00 mountain lions $10.00, cougar skins $10.00 each, and wolf skins only $2.50 each.

During this year, six coyote skins have been presented to the county clerk and nine bobcats. January 22, Miles Adamson of Gervais brought in one coyote. On February 17, Henry Peters of Sublimity claimed the bounty on one coyote. F. B. Lamb of Scotts Mills was paid on March 10, $8.00 for the skins of four bobcats.

Carl Shepherd of Scotts Mills received $4.00 for two bobcat skins March 13, and on March 27, Anton Lee brought in the skins of four bobcats and one coyote. Miles Adamson was paid $5.00 for the bounty on one female coyote on March 28, as the new law did not go into effect until May 29. July 16, J. E. Kinsey received the $2.00 bounty of a bobcat and J. H. Maulding on the same date received the bounty on a coyote and bobcat.

During the past ten years, the $10.00 bounty on a mountain lion killed in Marion county has been claimed but once and that was by H. M. Reece in 1909. The skin of but one gray wolf has been brought in for bounty during the ten years past. That was on August 25, 1909, by E. A. Taylor.

Lynx skins on which there is only a $2.00 bounty have been presented for bounty only three times during the past ten years. J. M. Titze claimed the $2.00 bounty January 31, 1911. On June 24, 1915, the $2.00 for a lynx skin was paid to J. M. Endzulis and on February 9, 1916 to C. C. Jones.

A black wolf skin was brought to the county clerk’s office on November 20, 1909, by E. A. Taylor, claiming the $5.00 bounty which was paid. On March 3, 1910, two black wolves skins were brought to the office by A. A. Richards and he was paid $5.00 each.

A cougar skin is worth $10.00 if proof is made that the animal was killed in this county. In 1910 bounties were paid on five cougars. In 1911 but three cougar skins were presented and in 1912 but one skin. The year 1913 saw but one cougar bounty paid in this county. But in 1914 bounty was paid on three cougars and on February 13, 1915, the $10.00 bounty was paid to F. White. This was the last cougar skin on which bounty was paid.

To secure the bounty on wild animals affidavit must be made that the animal had been killed within six months from date of presentation of skin, that it was killed in Marion county, that the animal from which the skin was taken was not brought or received dead or alive from any other county or state and that the said animal or animals were not fostered in captivity prior to killing.
