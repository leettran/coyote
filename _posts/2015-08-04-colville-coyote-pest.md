If the ranchers and sheep growers had their wish, there would be no coyotes in North America. The ranchers and sheep growers think that the only thing coyotes were made for is to kill cattle and sheep. This is a wrong impression. The coyotes must have some other calling in life or the good book missed fire when it said "nothing was made in vain." The coyote is here to give up the ghost and surrender his pelt to the furrier, who by the way, makes good use of the good coyote pelt, but has little use for the poor ones. The better grades of coyote are being dressed and dyed and used in imitation of fox, and on account of the great popularity of the animal scarf, coyotes are in strong demand and bringing the highest prices ever known. The coyote is the only fur-bearer that can be used in imitation of fox. The poorer grades of coyotes are being used for coat linings, lap robes, etc. The skin is large and requires but little workâ€”it answers the purpose. Seventy-five per cent of the best grades of the collection of the coyote of the northwest are used in America. Our manufacturers know better how to use them and our dyers dye them better than the Europeans. We make better and more attractive articles out of coyote than are produced anywhere. A soft, silky coyote, dressed and dyed, and made into an animal scarf can hardly be distinguished from a fox, except by an expert, so trappers get after the coyote and trap as many as you can, as the present high price for this article will pay you well for your time and efforts.
