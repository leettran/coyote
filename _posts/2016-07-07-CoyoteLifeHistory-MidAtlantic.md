### Abstract
Relatively little information has been published on Coyotes in the eastern 
United States, particularly in the mid-Atlantic region, the last area of the contiguous US 
to be colonized by Coyotes. Increases in eastern Coyote distribution and abundance have 
been documented, and concerns about their impact on wildlife and livestock are growing. 
Information from published and unpublished manuscripts, theses, dissertations, and state 
wildlife agency records in the mid-Atlantic region were examined and synthesized. This 
review provides a comprehensive summary of Coyote ecology in the mid-Atlantic for 
natural resource managers and researchers.
