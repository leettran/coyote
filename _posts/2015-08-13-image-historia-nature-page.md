"The Indians call one kind of fox “Coyotl” (coyote). It is an animal unknown in the Old World, with a wolf-like head, big, bright, pale eyes, small, pointed ears and a dark, long snout. Its claws are thick and curved, and its tail long and thick. It resembles our foxes (to whom it may be related), and is about half-way between a wolf and a fox in size. It hunts pigs and deer, and has been known to kill humans. Its coat is long and dappled. It is a wily hunter. If another animal snatches its prey, it can recognize the thief days later and hunts it down."
