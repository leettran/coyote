This game board illustration depicts a moment of predation. In the center of the image, a coyote is attacking a sheep. There are also chickens depicted in the squares.

At this writing, I have been unable to track down the rules, but the game appears similar to "coyotes and chickens," where two players participate. Player one is coyote, who works to capture and eat the chickens on the board. This happens by jumping over a chicken. As in checkers, more than one jump is allowed per move. Player two begins with twelve chickens and must manipulate the pieces so that the coyote is cornered and can no longer jump.
