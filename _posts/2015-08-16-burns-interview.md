Personal Interview R.C. Burns “Rollie Burns” by Dr. W.C.Holden. 

This is a story, which involves life and death among the wild animals on the South Plains, one which [indicator?], that after all animals do not differ very much from people, both having one and the same incentive, that of self-preservation.

It was in the summer of 1884, if I recall correctly, while riding the range I saw an antelope being run down by three coyotes
Antelopes as a rule always run in a straight line unless they are being pursued, in [?] case they will eventually move in a wide circle, like wild horses do. As I came upon the ridge I saw the antelope running in a circle with one coyote in pursuit.  Stopping to watch the procedure, I noticed the coyote that was doing the running, drop out, and [the?] other one took up the chase.  This coyote made several circles and then he too dropped out and the third one followed circling process.  It is beyond a doubt that these coyotes were using the same tactics that men use when running down wild horses.The longer the chase lasted, the  smaller the circle got to be and the more distance the coyote could cut and thus exhaust his prey.  Watching this scene for several hours mind you. I did not [interfere?] for I secretly admired the strategy and cunning which these animals displayed, and I felt that therefore they were entitled to their prey.
