Since coyote pelts are bringing record breaking prices in the domestic fur market and the extermination of this beast of prey is being sought by practically all the cattlemen in Arizona, especial interest is being attached to the government's introduction of a new poison tablet which has almost exterminated this animal in some sections of the state.

Possessed of an uncanny sense of taste and smell, the coyote can always detect any ordinary poisonous preparation before it will affect him. According to M. E. Musgrave, United States predatory animal inspector, a coyote can detect and emit poison from his stomach after he has swallowed it. Traps are seldom effective, as the coyote seems to sense their presence and avoids them. For this reason ranchers have been almost powerless to resist the costly invasion of coyotes into flocks of sheep.

Work to produce a poison which would become effective before it could be detected was started in the government laboratories here last November. This work was later transferred to the government office at Albuquerque, where facilities were better adapted for experimentation. A mixture of strychnine, sugar of milk and bicarbonate of soda was finally converted into small tablets which have proved the most effective form of poison.

These small tablets are placed in pieces of meat, which are thrown about in the vicinity of an animal carcass. The carcass is dragged, and the bait dropped at intervals of about 150 yards. Although suspicious of the dead animal, the coyote will pick up the smaller pieces of meat. Once swallowed, this tablet generates a poisonous gas in the stomach of the coyote which is deadly in its effect. Throwing off the tablet and bait will not counteract the effects of this gas, and death generally follows within 30 seconds after the poison has been assimilated.

According to Inspector Musgrave, there have been several thousand coyotes killed with this poison in the Salt River valley and immediate vicinity since its introduction here about two months ago. The poison campaign is now being carried on by the government in the northern part of the state.

Those who gather fur pelts for the market have reaped a harvest by following the trail of the poisoned baits and gathering up coyote carcasses. A coyote pelt ranges in value from $10 to $20 and there is a steady demand for all offerings in good condition.
