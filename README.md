# The Myth of Coyote

### Creating Source Material Items

`*.md` files should be named lowercase with hyphens, as these will be translated by Jekyll directly into URLs.

All source materials should have corresponding `_build/sources/_posts` files.

As those are Jekyll posts, they need to conform to the `YYYY-MM-DD` naming convention. For consistency, let's use this for the date the file was created, **not** the original publication date.

An optional `pubdate` value can be provided in the YAML front matter. This can be omitted if unavailable.

Each `_build/sources/_posts` file must include in the YAML front matter:

* `layout: source`
* `title: ...`: Title of the source item.
* `category: ...`: A single category this item will appear under in the index.
* `tags: ...`: A [YAML list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Lists) of tags.
* `type: ...`: article, image, text â€“ Try to stick to a concise set of consistent values.

Optional fields include:

* `pubdate: ...`: Original publication date, in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
* `source: ...`: Available to document the source of the item.

`_build/sources/_posts/2015-07-30-arizona-republican-poison.md` is an example to reference.

### Managing the Tag Index

To support pages that correspond to tags, and which output lists of matching source materials, each of those tags needs a post file created in `_build/tags/_posts`.

Each file should contain the date it was created in the file name, in the format `YYY-MM-DD`.

All words in the tag name should be included in the filename, separated by `-`, lowercase.

Each file must include the following in the YAML front matter:

* `layout: tag`
* `title: ...`: Title of the tag.

`title` **must** match the exact use of the tag in corresponding posts for those posts to be related to the tag.
